Healing Horizon is an application that would help identify the type of substance use/addiction (Ex. drugs, device or internet, alcohol, to name a few) a student has by asking set of non-judgemental questions to categorize and assist the 
counsellors in charge of running de-addiction / intervention programs. 
The valuable data gathered from the target audience, and the relevant insights gained through these intervention programs, can be presented to relevant forums.
